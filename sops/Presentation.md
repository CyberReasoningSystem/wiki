# Presentation

## Creation

1. Create the presentation support by following a layered strategy:
    - Slide titles;
    - General ideas, that will be used as bullets in the slides; and
    - Detailed ideas.
2. Create a transcript with the detailed ideas.
3. Place some markers into the transcript (for example, `CLICK`), when the one controlling the presentation needs to go to the next idea or slide.
4. Repeat the presentation before presenting it.

## Effective Presentation

1. Read slowly.
2. If the transcript is used, then delegate the task of controlling the slides to another person (will be guided by the markers from the transcript).
