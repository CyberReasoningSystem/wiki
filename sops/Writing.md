# Writing

1. Write the text in Markdown, considering the following aspects:
    - No short forms ("*it's*");
    - Agreed-upon forms of word (for consistency in word choosing):
        - "*state of the art*"
        - "*open source*"
        - "*for example*"
    - Highlights for main ideas; and
    - Storage of cites for resources, exported from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) in BibTeX format.
2. Use [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) to check the text's correctness.
3. For ease, use the script [`md_to_latex.py`](https://github.com/iosifache/scripts/blob/main/md_to_latex/md_to_latex.py) to convert from Markdown.
4. Import the [template](https://github.com/iosifache/ACSDocumentsTemplates) into Overleaf.
5. Populate the content section with the generated LaTeX code from the third step.
6. Export the document.
